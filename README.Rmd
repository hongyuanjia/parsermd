# parsermd

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of parsermd is to extract the content of an Rmarkdown file to allow for programmatic interactions with the code chunks and markdown contents.

## Installation

You can install the released version of parsermd from [GitHub](https://github.com/rundel/parsermd) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rundel/parsermd")
```

## Example - Minimal

This is a basic example which shows you the basic abstract syntax tree (AST) that results from parsing a simple Rmd file,

```{r example}
parsermd::parse_rmd(system.file("minimal.Rmd", package = "parsermd"))

```

## Example - Student Work
