**Note**: please ignore this example if the version of your **formatR** package is greater than `1.3.2`, because line breaks will be automatically preserved.

This demos shows you how to replace `\n` to a real line break in the source.

This is what you normally see in the output:

```{r test}
x = 'this is a long long
string with several
lines'
```

Modify the `source` hook:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) {
  paste0('\n\n```r\n', gsub('\\n', '\n', x, fixed=TRUE), '\n```\n\n')
})
```

Now we test the `source` hook:

```{r test2, ref.label='test'}
```
